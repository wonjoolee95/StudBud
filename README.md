StudBud is an online platform that allows students to easiily find study partners in courses of their choices. The application's simple
yet effective interface provides smooth navigation and use of its functionalities. 


Students can select and list themselves in various courses or choose a study partner already on the list. Student can also send an
automated email to a listed student of their choice. We extensively used HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL to
develop the application.
